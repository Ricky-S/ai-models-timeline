# Contributing

Thank you for helping to keep this repository up to date!  
When adding new models or updating entries, please follow these guidelines.

## Naming conventions

- Use the `YYYY‑MM‑DD‑model‑name.md` format for model files so they sort chronologically【848078365573110†L88-L103】.  
- Keep model names lower‑case and use hyphens to separate words (e.g. `2025‑09‑15‑super‑model.md`).  
- Place new files in a folder named after the company or institution that released the model (e.g. `openai/`, `google‑deepmind/`).  
  The folder will be created automatically if it doesn’t exist【153672543414021†L56-L79】.

## Timeline index

- Add a short entry to `timeline/<year>.md` including the date, model name, company and a relative link to the new file【443827285311051†L94-L112】.  
- Keep the entries in chronological order.

## Documentation

- Keep the `README.md` concise and add detailed descriptions in model files or the timeline.  
  If your entry is lengthy, consider linking to external resources rather than adding large amounts of text to the main README【553597927812998†L295-L345】.

## Citations

- Cite credible sources for each fact you include.  
- Use the format `【source†L..-L..】` to indicate the lines you referenced.
