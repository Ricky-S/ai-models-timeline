# AI Models Timeline

This repository tracks the latest artificial intelligence (AI) models, frameworks and algorithms released by companies and research institutions. The goal is to make it easy to explore AI developments both chronologically and by organisation.

## Repository structure

- Top-level directories are named after the company or institution that released the model (e.g. `google-deepmind/`, `harmonic/`).
- Model files inside each company directory are named `YYYY-MM-DD-model-name.md` and use ISO dates so that files are sorted chronologically【848078365573110†L88-L103】.
- The `timeline/` directory provides year‑by‑year index files summarising all models released in that year, with links back to the detailed model files. When a new model is added, its details should be added both in the appropriate company directory and in the timeline file for the year.
- A `CONTRIBUTING.md` file documents the naming conventions, directory structure and steps to contribute.

## How to browse

- **By company:** navigate to one of the company folders (e.g. [`google-deepmind`](./google-deepmind)) to see all models released by that organisation in chronological order.
- **By date:** visit the [`timeline`](./timeline) directory and open the file for the year of interest (e.g. [`2025.md`](./timeline/2025.md)). Each timeline file lists all models released that year with their dates, company, and a link to the detailed description.

## Contributing

Please see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on how to add new models, including naming conventions, directory placement and how to update the timeline.

## Sources

The structure and file‑naming guidelines are based on best practices for managing research data【153672543414021†L56-L91】【848078365573110†L88-L103】. The recommendation to keep the main README concise and link to additional documentation comes from GitHub and documentation guidelines【553597927812998†L295-L345】.
